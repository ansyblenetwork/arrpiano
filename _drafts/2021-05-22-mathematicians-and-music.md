title: "Mathematicians and music"

I think it is fair to say that music has a special place in the minds of most mathematicians. In an interview with Krista Tippet for the podcast _On Being_, Professor Chazelle at Princeton briefly described how Bach was something different:

<div class="media">
<p>It’s hard to explain, because I work in mathematics mostly, and I have great admiration for all kinds of mathematicians, like the true geniuses of history.</p>

<p>And even though I can only in my dream aspire to do that kind of work, I understand what it is. But Bach, I don’t. That’s the thing. In other words, it’s not just that I’m not gifted enough or something, it’s another dimension. It’s like if I met somebody from a different planet. And it’s a paradox, because I think Bach is the most human of composers. So obviously, there’s a contradiction there. How can he be both the most human, and be completely out of this world?</p>

Mathematics, or more precisely, its practice, has an odd and very democratic property: The worst mathematician is not fundamentally different from the greatest mathematician. This is because the primary object of mathematics is reasoning itself. Practicing mathematics incorporates short term memory, application of knowledge, cold deduction, and soft induction. 

Contrast this with other human pursuits, where the objectives include speed, strength, and victory. A slow sprinter has little value; a chess player who always loses is not interesting. A gauge of mathematicians also uses these measures of speed and success, but these measures are secondary.

So mathematicians have a hubris - the hubris I suggested when [launching this site]({% post_url 2021-05-17-about %}. It is the belief that a rational agent can learn the essence of many things - including the sciences, philosophy, language, games, and psychology. People trained in other fields have a misplaced interest in speed, skill, and knowledge - that without satisfying properties, a person has not learned or participated in the essence of a field. But the mathematician changes the goalpost, so to speak, because the mathematician recognizes that there is an essence to these activities that are worth understanding, having little to do with skill.
