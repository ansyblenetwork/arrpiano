Today's quote of the day comes from the introduction of Paul Hindemith's _The Craft of Musical Composition_:

<div class="media">
<p>The senses of sight and feeling need to make use of memory and comparison in order to arrive at even approximate judgements of size and proportion, and our sense of the passage of time similarly does not permit us to make exact estimates. The ear, on the other hand, is the one sense organ that is unerring in its sense of measurement and proportion. The eye is like a mirror that reports faithfully and disinterestedly on what is before it. But the ear is like a fabulous sieve, that not only sorts what it receives into large and small, but measures it exactly. It hears simple ratios as beautiful and correct sounds, and it recognizes perfectly that the purity of the octave, the fifth, or the fourth is clouded when the proportions of length or vibration frequency are not in the ratios of 1 : 2, 2 : 3, or 3 : 4... This basic fact of our hearing process reveals to us how closely related are numbers and beauty, mathematics and art.</p>

Although the twelve notes can be [discovered and justified]({% post_url 2021-05-21-twelve-notes %}) by seeking perfect fifths (and octaves) alone, one can ask about relationships between non-adjacent notes - those which are not separated by a perfect fifth.
