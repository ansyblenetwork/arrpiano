title: "The twelve notes of music"
---

Today's quote of the day comes from Richard Feynman:

<div class="media">
<p>All the kids were playing in the field and one kid said to me, “See that bird, what kind of a bird is that?” And I said, “I haven’t the slightest idea what kind of a bird it is.” He says, “It’s a brown-throated thrush,” or something, “Your father doesn’t tell you anything.”</p>

<p>But it was the opposite: my father had taught me. Looking at a bird he says, “Do you know what that bird is? It’s a brown-throated thrush; but in Portuguese it’s a Bom da Peida. In Italian a Chutto Lapittida.” He says “In Chinese it’s a Chung-long-tah, in Japanese a Katano Tekeda,” etcetera. “Now,” he says, “you can know in all the languages you want to know what the name of that bird is and when you’ve finished with all that,” he says, “you’ll know absolutely nothing whatever about the bird. You’ll only know about humans in different places and what they call the bird.</p>

<p>“Now,” he says, “let’s look at the bird.”</p>

So let's look at the notes of music. Why are there twelve notes in Western and modern music?



In the spirit of my [recent commentary]({% post_url 2021-05-19-music-and-mathematics %}) on taking a systematic approach, we first observe that this question can be decomposed into two:

1. Why are there not more than twelve notes?
2. Why are there not fewer than twelve notes?

The short answer to the first question is that _consonances_ are distinguished and rare. This is already somewhat evident within the twelve notes: Slamming the keys on a piano is more likely than not to produce some dissonant sounds. Having fewer notes helps control the dissonances. Blowing arbitrarily into say, a harmonica, typically doesn't sound so unpleasant, because there are fewer "open notes."

The answer to the second question is, I think, more subtle. My short answer would be that it is related to _symmetry_. By a quirk of arithmetic, having only say, two or some other small number of consonant notes would result in an asymmetric and scattered arsenal of pitches. In fact, insisting on a truly symmetric set of consonant notes is untenable: It would require the set to have infinitely many notes (or just one). 

We will see that by imposing some reasonable compromises, we find ourselves with twelve notes.
