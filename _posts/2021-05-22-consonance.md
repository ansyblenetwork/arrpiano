Today's quote of the day comes from the introduction of Paul Hindemith's _The Craft of Musical Composition_. He seems like a lot of fun:

<div class="media">
<p>We are constantly brought face to face with this confusion by a manner of writing which puts tones together according to no system except that dictated by pure whim, or that into which facile and misleading fingers draw the writer as they glide over the keys. Now something that cannot be understood by the analysis of a musician, making every conceivable allowance for individual characteristics, cannot possibly be more convincing to the naive listener. In Die Meistersinger one reads, it is true, that the composer must make his own rules and follow them. But this privilege is granted only to a master - one, moreover, who knows, or at least feels, the bases of his work provided by Nature.</p>
