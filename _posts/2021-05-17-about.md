When I first considered starting this site, the following anecdote from Robert Wolke's popular science novel came to mind:

<div class="media"><i>
<p>When Albert Einstein was in residence at the Institute for Advanced Study at Princeton University, an eager young newspaper reporter approached him one day, notebook in hand. “Well, Professor Einstein,” he asked, “what's new in science?”
  
<p>Einstein looked at him with his deep, soft eyes and replied, “Oh? Have you already written about all the old science?”
</i></div>

Here is another, attributed to Bach, speaking about playing the keyboard:

<div class="media"><i>
<p>There’s nothing remarkable about it. All one has to do is hit the right keys at the right time and the instrument plays itself.
</i></div>

I received classical training in piano before college. I wasn't particularly skilled or attentive, but I started listening to classical music during gradudate school. 

My training in music was entirely technical, so I learned nothing about the theory or composition. On the other hand, having studied mathematics in college, the associated hubris compels me to return and try learning the theory in a mathematical and systematic way.

My goal for this site is to document my progress as I learn about the fundamentals of music. I hope this might be interesting to people searching for information about:

1. Learning music composition.
2. Arrangements for solo piano with a sole focus on musicality - in particular, without bias for difficulty on either end of the spectrum.
3. Depending on my progress, technology and music - including music notation, synthesizing sound, recording.
