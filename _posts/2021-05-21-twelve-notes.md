title: "The twelve notes of music"

Today's quote of the day comes from Richard Feynman:

<div class="media">
<p>All the kids were playing in the field and one kid said to me, “See that bird, what kind of a bird is that?” And I said, “I haven’t the slightest idea what kind of a bird it is.” He says, “It’s a brown-throated thrush,” or something, “Your father doesn’t tell you anything.”</p>

<p>But it was the opposite: my father had taught me. Looking at a bird he says, “Do you know what that bird is? It’s a brown-throated thrush; but in Portuguese it’s a Bom da Peida. In Italian a Chutto Lapittida.” He says “In Chinese it’s a Chung-long-tah, in Japanese a Katano Tekeda,” etcetera. “Now,” he says, “you can know in all the languages you want to know what the name of that bird is and when you’ve finished with all that,” he says, “you’ll know absolutely nothing whatever about the bird. You’ll only know about humans in different places and what they call the bird.</p>

<p>“Now,” he says, “let’s look at the bird.”</p>

So let's look at the notes of music. Why are there twelve notes in Western and modern music?
