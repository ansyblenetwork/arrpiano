title: "Mathematics and music"

I think music has a special mystery, particularly to those who have studied some college mathematics. In an interview with Krista Tippet for the podcast _On Being_, Professor Chazelle at Princeton briefly described how Bach created something different:

<div class="media">
<p>It’s hard to explain, because I work in mathematics mostly, and I have great admiration for all kinds of mathematicians, like the true geniuses of history. And even though I can only in my dream aspire to do that kind of work, I understand what it is. </p>

<p>But Bach, I don’t. That’s the thing. In other words, it’s not just that I’m not gifted enough or something; it’s another dimension. It’s like if I met somebody from a different planet. And it’s a paradox, because I think Bach is the most human of composers. So obviously, there’s a contradiction there. How can he be both the most human, and be completely out of this world?</p>

Mathematics, or more precisely, its practice, has a particular and very democratic property: The worst mathematician is not fundamentally different from the greatest. There is value in understanding mathematics whether or not you enjoy it, and the bulk of this value can be realized whether or not you are good at it. This is because the primary object of mathematics is the reasoning itself, distilling some product out of knowledge, short term memory, hard deduction, and soft induction - abilities that define a living, thinking human.

Contrast this with other pursuits, where the primary objectives include speed, strength, knowledge, and success. A slow sprinter has little value; a chess player who always loses is not interesting. A ranking of mathematicians might also use these measures, but they are secondary.

Mathematicians have a hubris - the hubris I suggested when [launching this site]({% post_url 2021-05-17-about %}). It is the belief that a rational agent can and should learn the essence of many things - including the sciences, philosophy, language, games, and psychology - modulo the constraints of time imposed by an individual lifespan. Those trained in many other fields have a misplaced interest in speed and knowledge, and the belief that without achieving these properties, a person has not learned or participated in a field in a meaningful way. But the mathematician trusts that they can recognize and extract an essence to these activities that is worth understanding, regardless of - and without need for - skill.

There is another side to the hubris, which is the belief that there is nothing more than this. Remove this essence, and strip away decorative trappings that come of outsized skill, and there is nothing left. I emphasize this point to highlight how strong the mathematical hubris is: That if reasoning and logic cannot capture the essence of some activity, then there is nothing more to the activity than subjective enjoyment.

But then there is music. I feel a reluctance to claim that the essence of music is mathematical or rational. It doesn't seem quite like other scientific or even pseudoscientific disciplines, like physics, biology, and social science, which all have the luxury of being grounded as models for different aspects of reality. But I am also reluctant to dismiss music as merely a subjective or technical art. There is something universal about music, and this universality is evidence of some underlying principles. 

I want to work toward resolving for myself the mystery surrounding music. Chazelle and I - I suspect we might just be inadequately trained in the theory. What we see might be like a magic trick: Unaware of the outsized preparation that the performer goes to great lengths to conceal, we feel we are witnessing something wonderful. Unlike with a magical performance however, I hope the wonder persists beyond the revelation.
