title: "Mathematicians and music"

I think music has a special mystery, particularly to those who have studied some math. In an interview with Krista Tippet for the podcast _On Being_, Professor Chazelle at Princeton briefly described how Bach was something different:

<div class="media">
<p>It’s hard to explain, because I work in mathematics mostly, and I have great admiration for all kinds of mathematicians, like the true geniuses of history.</p>

<p>And even though I can only in my dream aspire to do that kind of work, I understand what it is. But Bach, I don’t. That’s the thing. In other words, it’s not just that I’m not gifted enough or something; it’s another dimension. It’s like if I met somebody from a different planet. And it’s a paradox, because I think Bach is the most human of composers. So obviously, there’s a contradiction there. How can he be both the most human, and be completely out of this world?</p>

Mathematics, or more precisely, its practice, has a particular and very democratic property: The worst mathematician is not fundamentally different from the greatest mathematician. There is value in understanding mathematics whether you enjoy it or not, and the bulk of this value can be realized whether you are good at it or not. This is because the primary object of mathematics is the reasoning itself, distilling some product out of short term memory, application of knowledge, cold deduction, and soft induction. 

Contrast this with other human pursuits, where the primary objectives include speed, strength, knowledge, and success. A slow sprinter has little value; a chess player who always loses is not interesting. A ranking of mathematicians might also use these measures of speed and success, but they are secondary.

Mathematicians have a hubris - the hubris I suggested when [launching this site]({% post_url 2021-05-17-about %}. It is the belief that a rational agent can and should learn the essence of many things - including the sciences, philosophy, language, games, and psychology - modulo the constraints of time and life. People trained in other fields have a misplaced interest in speed, skill, and knowledge, and the belief that without satisfying these properties, a person has not learned or participated in a field in a worthwhile way. But the mathematician trusts that they can recognize and extract an essence to these activities that is worth understanding, regardless of - and without need for - skill.

There is another side to this hubris, which is the belief that there is nothing more. Remove this essence, and strip away decorative trappings that come out of outsized speed, skill, and knowledge, and there should be nothing else interesting to observe. I emphasize this point to highlight how strong the mathematical hubris is: That if reasoning and logic cannot capture the essence of some activity, then there is nothing to the activity worth understanding.
